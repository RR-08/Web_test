        <h1 class="h">Why read books daily?</h1>
        <p>When you read a book, you have to remember an assortment of characters, their backgrounds, ambitions, history, and
        nuances, as well as the various arcs and sub-plots that weave their way through every story. That’s a fair bit to
        remember, but brains are marvellous things and can remember these things with relative ease.
        
        Amazingly enough, every new memory you create forges new synapses (brain pathways) and strengthens existing ones,
        which assists in short-term memory recall as well as stabilizing moods.

            <h1>Why write often?</h1>
            <p>Most of us have very busy schedules as well as a fair bit of stress on our minds, and it’s not uncommon for these things
            to weigh on us when we actually have a few moments’ respite from non-stop responsibilities—like when we’re trying to
            sleep. Consider keeping a notepad or journal beside your bed, and allot 15-20 minutes every night to writing down your
            thoughts about the day. If there are things that are stressing you out, getting them down on paper to acknowledge them
            may help to alleviate the anxiety so you can get some rest</p>

        <h1>Why learn a musical intrument?</h1>
        <p>Did you know that learning to play an instrument increases your memory capacity? There’s plenty of research proving that
        this is the case. The Times reported that ‘new research suggests that regularly learning to play an instrument changes
        the shape and power of the brain.’!
    Learning music requires you to use both your literacy and maths skills, which is why it can really help to aid children
    in their academics.</p>

        <h1>Why learn roller skating?</h1>
        <p>There are obvious physical health benefits of roller skating, but there are also mental health benefits of roller sports
        as well. Roller skating clears the mind, minimizes mild forms of depression, and it just makes you happy.
        
        Roller skating reduces bad hormones and while it does this, it increases the good endorphins, which are commonly known
        as the ‘happy hormones’.!</p>
